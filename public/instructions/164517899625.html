each week. This should be your normal weekly schedule, plus additional hours you may work on a
consistent basis. Do not complicate your answer by considering holidays and other intermittent time off.
Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
If your regular schedule is 35 hours per week, and you often work 2 hours of overtime each week,
then your response should be 37 hours.</li>
<li>
If you are part-time and scheduled 20 hours per week, but you often work 4 hours more each week,
then your response should be 24 hours.

<p>The next page is the Support Activities introduction screen. The following page of the survey lists 7
  categories of support activities. Considering ALL the activities you perform, indicate which you do more
  of, or less of, by entering a percentage for each. When complete, the page must total 100%.
</p>  

<p>The 7 categories represent activities, not departments or functional groups. With your responses, you are
  describing how much time you devote to each category of activities, not which department or functional
  area you are in. </p>

 <ul><li>If you are in the Business Development and Marketing team but you also have budgeting,
  training, and management tasks, you should enter the percentage of time you work on each of
  those areas (Finance, Human Resources, and Leadership and Management respectively), rather
  than assigning 100% to Business Development and Marketing.

      <h1>Helpful Tips</h1>


<h2>Do not over-think your responses.</h2>
<p>Your goal is to describe the activities you perform. There are no right or wrong answers. Simply answer
  thoughtfully and with your best estimation.</p>



      
<h2>Take your time.</h2>
<p>Carefully read each description so you understand what activities are included. The terminology within
  the survey and that used by your firm may differ.</p>

 
      
<h2>Making Percentages Easier</h2>
<p>A little tip if you are struggling with percentages: As you read each description, if you perform any of the
  activities described, enter “10%”. Repeat for each of the activity listed. Once you have entered “10%” for
  each activity you perform, revise the percentages up, or down, until they closely approximate your role. </p>

 
      
<h2>If you are on a page where the activities do not look familiar…</h2>
<p>You may have made an incorrect selection on a previous page. To correct the selection, simply move back
  by selecting <span style="color:rgb(180, 44, 44);">[These Don’t Apply]</span> at the bottom of the screen. Correct your percentages and proceed
  normally.</p>

 
      
<h2>If you cannot finish the survey…</h2>
<p>You can exit and return later by selecting [Save & Exit] at the bottom of the screen. When you return, the
  survey will ask you if you want to resume where you left off, or start over. Starting over deletes all your
  previous responses, so be careful which option you choose.
  </p>

 
      
<h2>Need help?</h2>
<p>Should you have any technical problems completing the survey please email
  <a href="mailto:was-support@freeborn.com">was-support@freeborn.com</a>. Should you have further questions you can contact your <span style="color: rgb(241, 76, 76);">department head</span>.</p>
